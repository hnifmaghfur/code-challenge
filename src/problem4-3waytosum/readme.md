# Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n

# Task

Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in TypeScript.

- Comment on the complexity or efficiency of each function.

**Input**: `n` - any integer

*Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`*.

**Output**: `return` - summation to `n`, i.e. `sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15`.

# Answer

I'm using typescript to implement the following 3 ways to sum to n:

1. Using a for loop
2. Using a Array with forEach loop
3. Using Formula

## How to Run the code

- you need to install typescript by running `npm install typescript`
- then you need to generate file to be javascript file by running `tsc --target es2015 3waytosum.ts`
- then you can run the code in the terminal by typing `node 3waytosum.js`
